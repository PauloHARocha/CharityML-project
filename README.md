A challenge to evaluate knowledge in Machine Learning.

# Librarys and packages

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter

## How to test it locally

1. run `git clone https://gitlab.com/datasciencebr/test-paulo-rocha.git` to clone this repository
2. `git checkout solution` to access the solution branch with the results
2. make sure you have python 3 installed in your local machine, you can download at `https://python.org`
3. `cd test-paulo-rocha/` then run `virtualenv env --python=python3` to create the python environment
4. `source env/bin/activate` to start the environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the librarys
5. `jupyter notebook report.ipynb` to initialize the jupyter notebook


### Code

Template code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
